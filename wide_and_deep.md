- **Generalized linear models with nonlinear feature transformations**
- memorization of feature interactions are **effective and interpretable**, while **generalization** requires more **feature engineering**
- Deep learning can generalize better to unseen feature combinations through low-dimensional dense embedding learned for the sparse features with less feature engineering
- However deep neural networks with embeddings can over-generalize and recommend less relevant items when the user-item interactions are sparse and high-rank
- Jointly trained wide linear models and deep neural networks (This is why we call this model 'wide and deep')
